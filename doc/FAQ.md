# Frequently Asked Questions

### Is xatk compatible with my window manager?

xatk uses some hints specified in
[EWMH](http://standards.freedesktop.org/wm-spec/wm-spec-latest.html). So xatk
should work fine with window managers that support such hints. Metacity/Mutter,
KWin, Compiz, Openbox, Awesome have been reported to work with xatk. Share your
experience with us via [issue tracking system](https://github.com/vlevit/xatk/issues).

## Customizing

All customizations are done by modifying xatk's configuration file
`~/.xatk/xatkrc`. Before making any changes ensure that xatk is not running.

### How to assign keybindings to the certain windows permanently?

Crate a rule and prefix awn with !. For example,

    class.emacs = !e

### How to forbid xatk to assign keybindings to the certain windows?

Crate a rule and specify empty awn. For example,

    class.emacs =

### How to make xatk ignore all windows except a few ones?

Specify rules for windows which should not be ignored and the following rule at
the end of RULES:

    class..* =

### How to forbid xatk to modify all window titles?

Set title\_format to None.

### How to disable multi-key shortcuts?

Change group\_windows\_by option value to None.

### Shortcuts for my windows change all the time.

Try to increase the value of history\_length option or specify premanent keys for
some windows.

### How to make two windows belong to the same group?

Windows belong to the same group if they have identical awn attributes.
You can specify identical awns for those windows in the RULES section.

### I want shortcuts to be in certain order (e.g. q,w,e,r...) without considering programs they belong to.

You can set history\_length to 0, group\_windows\_by to None and
define the rule like this:

    title..*=qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm

## Miscellaneous

### How can I get a window class or instance?

#### With xatk ####

First stop xatk if it is running. Run xatk with the following options:

    xatk --no-daemon --filter=windows --verbose

You will see information messages starting with `new window attributes`. These
lines contain klass, instance and name attributes. They correspond to window
class, instance and title respectively.

#### With xprop ####

Run `'xprop WM_CLASS'` and select a window. The first string after '=' is a window
instance and the second one is a window class.

#### With wmctrl ####

`wmctrl -xl` prints a window list on the standard output. The second
column is in `instance.class` format.
