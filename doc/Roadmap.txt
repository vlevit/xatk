Roadmap 

It is planned to implement next features for 0.1 version of xatk:

  • add KEYBINDINGS section to .xatkrc
      □ add keybinding to exit the program
      □ add keybinding to reload .xatkrc
      □ add keybinding to write history to .xatkrc
  • prevent changing titles very often (if the application updates its title
    too often, or it watches title changes and modifies it (as we do))
