Roadmap 

xatk 0.2 or later

  • add keybindings to quit xatk, reload config and update history in the
    config;
  • generate dump files on unhandled exceptions;
  • prevent xatk to start a new instance when one is already running;
  • run-or-raise behaviour (run program if it has no window);
  • alt-tab-like behaviour for cycling shortcuts for grouped windows (more
    recently used windows are raised first);
  • revert states of the windows while cycling (e.g. iconify them if they were
    iconified before);
  • user-defined keyboard layouts;
  • provide current list of windows and corresponding shortcuts (via pipe or a
    regular file?);
  • make program's name as another source to form awns;
  • prevent updating window names too often.
