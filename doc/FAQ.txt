Frequently Asked Questions 

Customizing 

How to tell xatk not to modify window titles? 

Set title_format to None in ~/.xatkrc.

How to disable multi-key shortcuts? 

Change group_windows_by option value to None.

How to change shortcut for <your application>? 

Make sure xatk is not running (you can stop it with "pkill -f xatk"). Open ~
/.xatkrc and find your application of interest in the HISTORY section. Change
the existing shortcut to the one you like. It should be a single Latin
alphabetical character. If your application is not present there, you should
know its awn attribute (window class by default) to make a new entry. Then run
xatk again. Note, that this doesn't guarantee your application will have the
shortcut you specified, HISTORY is more like recommendation (the key you
specified may be grabbed by another program or already used by xatk for another
window).

Shortcuts for my windows change all the time. 

Try to increase the value of history_length option.

How to make <application 1> and <application 2> belong to the one group? 

Windows belong to the one group if they have identical awn attributes. You can
specify identical awns for these applications in the RULES section.

I want shortcuts to be in certain order (e.g. q,w,e,r...) without considering
applications they belong to. 

You may want to set history_length to 0, group_windows_by to None and define
the rule like this:

title..*=qwertyuiopasdfghjklzxcvbnm

Debugging 

xatk doesn't start 

Run xatk in the terminal and look at the output. Probably it is something wrong
with your configuration.

xatk crashes 

You can pass --no-daemon option to xatk to see errors in the terminal. It is
also useful to specify --verbose to get debugging messages printed to the
standard output. Higher level of verbosity can be achieved with -vv.

More preferable option is logging to a file, as it contains more debugging
information. For this purpose, specify --log-file option. Pass --backup-count=N
to xatk to save last N+1 logs. It is advised to create a new issue with a log
attached. Make sure that the log file doesn't contain any sensitive or personal
data before uploading it.

Miscellaneous 

How can I obtain a window class property? 

Run

xprop | grep WM_CLASS

and select a window. The second string after '=' is what you need.
